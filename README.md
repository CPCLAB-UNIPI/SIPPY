## Systems Identification Package for PYthon (SIPPY)

SIPPY is a library for linear model identification of dynamic systems. It aims to be the most user-friendly and comprehensive library for system identification in Python. 

Originally developed by Giuseppe Armenise at the Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering of University of Pisa under supervision of [Prof. Gabriele Pannocchia](https://people.unipi.it/gabriele_pannocchia/).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

To identify system as Auto-Regressive with eXogenous Inputs model (ARX) using Linear Least Squares  (LLS) on example data, simply run:

```python
from sippy_unipi import system_identification
from sippy_unipi.datasets import load_sample_siso

Y, U = load_sample_siso()

Id_ARX = system_identification(
    Y,
    U,
    "ARX",
    *([4], [[3]], [2], [[11]]),
    id_mode="LLS",
)
```

Get your hand on the algorithms using following Jupyter notebooks and play around with open-spource example data:

* [ARX systems (multi input-multi output case)](https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY/blob/master/Examples/Ex_ARX_MIMO.py)
* [ARMAX systems (single input-single output case)](https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY/blob/master/Examples/Ex_ARMAX.py)
* [ARMAX systems (multi input-multi output case)](https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY/blob/master/Examples/Ex_ARMAX_MIMO.py)
* [Input-output structures (using optimization methods)](https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY/blob/master/Examples/Ex_ARMAX_MIMO.py)
* [Input-output structures (using recursive methods)](https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY/blob/master/Examples/Ex_OPT_GEN-INOUT.py)
* [State space system (multi input-multi output case)](https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY/blob/master/Examples/Ex_SS.py)
* [Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor](https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY/blob/master/Examples/Ex_CST.py)

## üõ† Installation

Intended to work with Python 3.10 and above. Building project dependencies requires C compiler (euther CMake or Ninja). Pre-build wheels are currently not available (feel free to contribute).

Simply run:

```bash
pip install sippy_unipi
```

To install from source, use poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

Alternatively, you can use Docker to set up the environment. Follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t sippy .
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm sippy
```
